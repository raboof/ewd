  <p><b>Exercises in making programs robust</b>.
<p>(This is a sequel to the very exploratory EWD452: &ldquo;About robustness and
the like&rdquo; which was initiated in September 1974 and closed on 31st January 1975)<p>In this report I shall pursue a very simple idea. Provided that we give
an adequate formulation of what we admit as &ldquo;a single machine malfunctioning&rdquo;,
we can interpret the effort as that of making a program in such a way that
under the assumption of at most a single malfunctioning, the machine will never
&rsquo;produce a wrong result as if it were the right one. I shall not, however,
start my considerations with a very precise definition of the class of 
malfunctionings I am going to allow a single instance of: the probability that
I have designed a tool of which, after much hard labour, we must conclude that
it is insufficient for reaching our goal, is then just too high. I shall 
therefore start at the other end, and investigate the consequences of applying a
technique which &mdash;with a certain amount of goodwill&mdash; can be viewed as &ldquo;making&rdquo;
a program more robust&ldquo; and afterwards analyse, which class of malfunctionings
it catches under the assumption of at most a single instance. The more elaborate
exercises, I am sorry to announce, will be rather painful ones, because we
cannot do them with too simple examples: if the example is very simple &mdash;like
forming the sum of a hundred stored values&mdash; the only way to make the program
more robust boils (in some way or another) down to doing the computation twice
and I am &mdash;obviously!&mdash; more interested in what we can achieve without paying
that price. (All by itself, this observation is already somewhat alarming:
under assumption of a perfect machine, we are used to break down the whole
computation as a succesion of little steps, all of them trivial by themselves,
but if they can only be made more robust by duplication, our robustness concerns
force us to consider larger &ldquo;units&rdquo;. This seems a warning, that we are tackling
a nasty subject!)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>A very simple example to start with. A common program structure to 
establish a relation R is
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(1)</td><td>establish P; <b>do</b> BB &rarr; S <b>od</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
where</td><td>(P <b>and</b> BB) => wp(S, P)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
and</td><td>(P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB) => R
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and we could replace (1) by
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(2)</td><td>establish P; <b>do</b> BB &rarr; S <b>od</b>; <b>if</b> P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB &rarr; skip <b>fi</b>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
where the added statement causes abortion if the loop terminates with
<b>non</b> P <b>or</b> BB, i.e. in a state in which we are not entitled to conclude the
validity of R.
<p>Time-wise this seems an attractive modification, because it does not
generate an overhead on the repeatable statement S . An example would be
(for N &ge; 0) with
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
R:</td><td><b>do</b> a<sup>2</sup> and (a+1)<sup>2</sup> > N and P: a<sup>2</sup> &le; N
</td>  </tr>  </table>
to add to the program
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      a:= 0 {P}; <b>do</b> (a+1)<sup>2</sup> &le; N &rarr; a:= a+1 <b>od</b> {R} </td> </tr>
</table>
the checking statement
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      <b>if</b> a<sup>2</sup> &le; N <b>and</b> (a+1)<sup>2</sup> > N &rarr; skip <b>fi</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>But this example immediately illustrates the very restricted &mdash;i.e.
nearly empty&mdash; range of applicability of this transformation: it only
works in those cases where finding the answer may be hard, but checking the
answer is (always!) easy. These cases seem to be rather the exception than
the rule, and it would not amaze me if, often, when we think that we have
found an example, the property that the correctness of a result is so easily
checked can be used to speed up the process of finding one. (The above square
root example is, indeed, ridiculously inefficient for larger values of N.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>What do we do, if &mdash;as for instance, when the correctness proof appeals
to the Linear Search Theorem&mdash; the verification of P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB amounts to
redoing the computation? Very crudely, if our first program operates on a
variable (set) x
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(3)</td><td>establish P(x);
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>do</b> BB(x) &rarr; S(x) <b>od</b> .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
we could introduce a second set of variables, y say, and duplicate (under
the assumption of determinacy)
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(4)</td><td>establish P(x);
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>do</b> BB(x) &rarr; S(x) <b>od</b>;
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>establish P(y); 
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>do</b> BB(y) &rarr; s(y) <b>od</b>;
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>if</b> x = y &rarr; skip <b>fi</b> .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>We can also merge the two processes, but
establish P(x) and P(y)
<b>do</b> BB(x) &rarr; S(x); S(y) <b>od</b>;
if x = y &rarr; skip <b>fi</b>
is a little bit too optimistic if we allow &mdash;and I think that we should&mdash;
erroneous sequencing as would result from an erroneous evaluation of a guard
as possible malfunctioning:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(5)</td><td>establish P(x) and P(y);
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>do</b> BB(x) &rarr; <b>if</b> BB(y) &rarr; S(y) <b>fi</b>; S(x) <b>od</b>;
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>if</b> <b>non</b> BB(y) and x = y &rarr; skip <b>fi</b>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
is in this sense safe.
<p>Up till now, there has been no gain by the transition from (4) to (5).
But a fairly common structure of type (3), however, operates on a state
space (x, z) and has the general form
establish P1(z) and P2(x, z);
<b>do</b> B1(z) and B2(x, z) &rarr; x:= f(x, z); z:= g(z) <b>od</b>
<p>Here, repeated application of z:= g(z) generates a sequence of 
z-values &mdash;on account of B1(z) possibly finite&mdash; and in the variable x , some
function value of this sequence of z-values is computed (collected, if you
prefer). The relation P1(z) &mdash;which z:= g(z) will keep invariant&mdash; has been
introduced to represent any possible redundancy in the representation of z.
(If this redundancy is absent, P1(z) does not depend on z at all, is
identically true and the remainder of this section &mdash;probably the whole report&mdash;
is no longer applicable.) If B2(x, z) is identically true, the sequencing
is independent of x and, therefore, of the function f. If however, we
are looking for the first z-value (if any) that satisfies some property &mdash;e.g.
if we are looking for the smallest divisor less than the square root plus one&mdash;
B2 indicates that the search can be stopped as soon as a z-value satisfying
the criterion has been found.
<p>Again, we can merge to two copies, but what about letting the two state
spaces share the same z ?
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(6)</td><td>establish P1(z) and P2(x, z) and P2(y, z);                                              
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
    <b>do</b> B1(z) <b>and</b> B2(x, z) &rarr;                                                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         <b>if</b> B1(z) <b>and</b> B2(y, z) &rarr; y:= (y, z) <b>fi</b>;                        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
         x:= f(x, z); z:= g(z)                                                                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
    <b>od</b>                                                                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
    <b>if</b> <b>non</b> (B1(z) <b>non</b> B2(y, z)) <b>and</b> x = y &rarr; skip <b>fi</b>  .   </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>How good is (6)? Suppose that the values of x , y and z are currently
all correct, but that the evaluation of a guard is incorrect: as this incorrect
evaluation is supposed to be the only malfunctioning, it will either itself
cause abortion, or the next guard evaluation will do so. Suppose that the
value of x has been corrupted and that this was our only malfunctioning,
which is assumed to imply that y and z are and will remain correct.
There are three cases: either we will, during x &ne; y , encounter a case that
B2(x, z) &ne; B2(y, z) and this will cause abortion; the second possibility is
that, although x &ne; y remains, this will not occur, but then the last guard
will cause abortion (on account of x = y ). The third possibility is that this
last abortion will not occur, because in the mean time x = y has been 
re-established, i.e. the (apparently information destroying) operation x:= f(x, z)
has absorbed the malfunctioning: apparently, it did not matter! For a corruption
of y (with the assumption that then x and z are, therefore, correct) the
same applies. We are left with a corruption of z.
<p>The operation z:= g(z) is already supposed to satisfy
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(7)</td><td>(P1(z) <b>and</b> B1(z)) &rArr; wp(&ldquo;z:= (z)&rdquo;, P1(z)) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
i.e. it is supposed not to destroy the validity of P1(z). If we assume that
the operation z:= g(z) will, in addition, not destroy the validity of <b>non</b> P1(z)
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(8)</td><td>(<b>non</b> P1(z) <b>and</b> B1(z)) &rArr; wp(&ldquo;z:= g(z)&rdquo;, <b>non</b> P1(z))
</td>  </tr>  </table>
&mdash;i.e. will keep P1(z) invariant in the strict sense&mdash;, then changing the last
line of (6) into
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      <b>if</b> <b>non</b> (B1(z) <b>and</b> B2(y, z)) <b>and</b> x = y <b>and</b> P1(z) &rarr; skip <b>fi</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
will guarantee that a corruption of z will be caught as well, if we assume
that
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
(9)</td><td>z is represented in such a redundant fashion, that any corruption of
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>it, that would not destroy the validity of P1(z) can be regarded as
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>a multiple malfunctioning, or, to put it in another way, each single
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>malfunctioning affecting z will make P1(z) false.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>I have done extensive exercises with a program solving the following
problem: generate all cyclic arrangements of 16 zeroes and 16 ones, such
that all 32 possible configurations of 5 successive bits occur (and therefore:
exactly once). Another formulation of describing the same problem is: generate
all permatations h<sub>0</sub> ... h<sub>31</sub> of the numbers 0 through 31 that
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
0)</td><td>h<sub>0</sub>=0 , 
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
2)</td><td>suc(h<sub>i</sub>, h<sub>i+1</sub>) for 0 &le; i < 31
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
3)</td><td>suc(h<sub>31</sub>, h<sub>0</sub>) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
where suc(a, b) = (a <b>mod</b> 16 = b <b>div</b> 2) .
<p>It is in the latter form that we shall tackle it. First of all:
because suc(0, x) has only the solutions x = 0 and x = 1, and h<sub>1</sub> &ne; h<sub>0</sub> ,
it follows that h1 = 1 . Therefore in a permutation satisfying 
1) and 2) it follows that h<sub>31</sub> = 16, for: suc(16, x) has as only solutions
x = 0 and x = 1 and thus, for all i < 31 we have h<sub>i</sub>&ne; 16. In short, we
can drop for the permutation requirement 3) as it is implied by the others.
-The original inner block as designed by W.H.J.Feijen, was essentially the

<p>The extensive exercises, however, have been thrown into the 
waste-paper basket, because they had a very ad hoc character and the proofs that
the resulting programs were resistant to a single malfunctioning either
failed or became so laborious as to become unconvincing. It was that 
disappointing experience that prompted me to try to formulate &mdash;&ldquo;in abstracto&rdquo;
so to speak&mdash; what I was really doing, while designing the above robust
structure (6). My next experiment will therefore be to try the above general
technique in a hopefully systematic manner to this specific program. (In order
to keep the experiment fair, I shall not exploit the fact that something more
about the answer is known: it has been proved that the number of solutions
equals 2048 , but we continue as if this theorem were unknown to us.)
<p>To establish the connection: the general x of (6) corresponds to the
output array x of our example and the role of the general z of (6) has
been taken over by the pair h, p in our example. Relation P2 is the
simple (and not too interesting) one: in our example it is
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=15%>
P2(x, h, p):</td><td> the value of the array variable x &ldquo;consists&rdquo; of all solutions
in alphabetical order that precede alphabetically the permutations
that begin with
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; h(0) ... h.high .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
(The term &ldquo;consists&rdquo; is loose, but hopefully clear enough. It is further to
be noted that in the above formulation of P2 , the boolean &ldquo;presence&rdquo; array p
is not mentioned.)
<p>Relation P1 is more interesting: it consists of two terms P1.1(h) <b>and</b>
P1.2(h, p):
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=15%>
P1.1(h):</td><td>for all i satisfying h.lob &le; i &lt; h.hib we have suc(h(i),h(i+1)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
P1.2(h, p):</td><td>for all k satisfying 0 5 &le; k &lt; 32,
p(k) implies that there exists 1 value for i, and
<b>non</b> p(k) implies that there exists no value for i , such that
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;h.lob &le; i &le; h.hib <b>and</b> h(i) = k .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>According to P1.l , the integer array h contains in general redundant
information: a boolean array &mdash;manipulating the bits of the original statement
of the problem would have done the job also&mdash;. Feijen replaced the boolean
array by an integer array for reasons of efficiency.
<p>According to P1.2 the boolean presence array p stores purely 
additional information that follows functionally from h; it has been introduced
also for reasons of efficiency by Feijen.
<p>And here lies our hope for gain: the redundancy that we need for the
robust presentation of z may already be present for efficiency&rsquo;s sake!
<p>We may wonder, whether the redundancy provided by h and p is 
sufficient: because p follows uniquely from h , a scrambling of the value of
p will always violate P1.2 . It is, however possible to scramble h without
violating P1.1 nor P1.2 (it is difficult, but it can be done). This can
be remedied by replacing the boolean &ldquo;presence&rdquo; array p by an integer &ldquo;place&rdquo;
array p, satisfying the new
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=15%>
P1.2(h, p):</td><td>for all k satisfying 0 &le; k &lt; 32,
</td></tr>

As the cost is negligible and it is our plan to do a thorough job, I propose
to switch to the integer &ldquo;place&rdquo; array p. (The last requirement i &ge; 0 has
been added because it is a simplification to extend the array h at the low
end with h(-1) = 16 for the verification of P1.1 : upon removal of a top
element the array h does not become empty.)
<p>The critical operation is now &ldquo;z:= g(z)&rdquo;. We must change it so as to
satisfy (8) as well. We can, indeed, insert additional tests that would lead
to abortion if the intended modification of z would lead to a violation
of <b>non</b> P1(z) , but this is not sufficient, because how do we know that the
correct new value of z has been assigned to it? (If z:= g(z) would have
acted as a skip, we might produce the same solution twice!)
<p>The critical value, of course, is that of &ldquo;c&rdquo;: if the initialization
of c had erroneously been carried out as
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                  c <b>vir</b> int := 2 *(h.high <b>mod</b> 16) + 1 </td> </tr>
</table>
a whole class of solutions could be skipped.
<p>So we had better concentrate upon the active scope of c and repeat
our games (or similar ones: wait and see). We have for the active scope of
c &mdash;i.e. more precisely: until the extension h:hiext(c)&mdash; if all goes wel
the invariant relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P3(h, c):</td><td>suc(h.high, c) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Because (<b>non</b> P3(h, c)) &rArr; wp(&ldquo;h:hiext(c)&rdquo;, <b>non</b> P1.1(h))
<br>it suffices, as far as our obligations versus the invariance of non P1.1(h
is concerned, to keep during the active scope, besides <b>non</b> P3(h, c) also
<b>non</b>(P1.1(h) <b>and</b> P3(h, c)) invariant, i.e. we do not need to check, whether
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           c, h:hipop </td> </tr>
</table>
perhaps could destroy <b>non</b> P1.1(h), because that would imply the emergence of
<b>non</b> P3(h, c), which will not disappear unnoticed.
<p>As P3(h, c) covers the four most significant digits of c, the least
significant digit of c seems to be our remaining Achilles heel. I propose
to count the number of even numbers among
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
    h(0) through h(h.hib), extended with c during the latter&rsquo;s active scop </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>This will catch erroneous initialization of c ; if the guard odd(c)
is erroneously evaluated, an even c will disappear without the count being
decreased, if the gaurd is erroneously evaluated false, c:= c + 1 will 
increase the number of even values, while it should decrease them by one. This
count is a kind of fancy parity bit. The full program is shown

<p>The comparison of the global values x and y , which should be equal,
has been delegated to the surroundings.

<p class=noindent>(Warning: the proof reading of the program text on page EWD482 - 6 has not b
done with the same care as I spent to the pages of my book.)
<p>Let me give some explanatory notes.
<br>The outer guard h(0) = 0 is not repeated automatically, if true: it only
matters, when we think that we have found a solution, and then it should be
confirmed by p(0) = 0; this means that after the last solution has been found
and p(1) is already = 1, it would not be detected if the outer repetition we
on for a while. Why should it?
<p>The operations, which are essentially of the form x:= f(x, z) and
y:= f(y, z) are themselves fully unchecked: if something goes wrong there
that is harmful, different values of x and y will result. Note that
the test, whether a new solution has been found is repeated: once for x
and once for y .
<p>The conclusion that p(c) &ge; 0 holds, has to be confirmed, otherwise
the erroneous conclusion that extension with c would lead to duplication
would cause possibly a large collection of solutions to be skipped. (This
additional confirmation was lacking in my first version of the robust program
I observed the omission while typing these notes!) The conclusion that on
account of <b>non</b> p(c) &ge; 0 the repetition has to be terminated is asked for
confirmation 7 lines lower.
<p>The test odd(c) in the innermost repetition does not need further
confirmation, as all erroneous evaluation would leave its traces in a 
non-correct value of n.
<p>Finally, at the end of our original program, it is checked &mdash;somewhat
superfluously&mdash; that h.dom = 2; the test h(0) = 1 is necessary for the 
confirmation that the outermost repetition has not stopped too early, thereby
possibly missing a number of the last solutions. Finally P1.2(h, p) is
fully checked. (We can regard the test h.dom = 2 as part of that test, so
perhaps its presence is fully justified after all.)
<p>And this concludes my treatment of this example.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>As the plurals in my title betray, I had originally in mind to deal wit
more examples. At second thought I shall confine myself in this report to thi
single example: I am already on the eighth page, with single space typing.
Although I had announced, that the exercises would be &ldquo;rather painful ones&rdquo;,
I did not expect, that it would be so painful. So I think that I should send
the report now away, as it stands, hoping for helpful comments. Therefore a f
concluding remarks.
If the inefficiency of our final program &ldquo;hurts&rdquo;, we should be aware of
the following considerations. Why does it &ldquo;hurt&rdquo;? Well, because the many test
that we have inserted, are on the one hand assumed to absorb computer time,
on the other hand &mdash;unless the machine is completely lousy&mdash; will be very
skew: of course, for if the machine were perfect, they would not give 
information at all! The normal reaction to such very skew tests has been to devote
dedicated hardware to them (vide the parity check or the interrupt circuit).
If techniques, as displayed in this report, would be applied to general purpo
programs &mdash;note, that I have not made up my mind, whether-that would be a goo
thing!&mdash; this conflict could perhaps be solved by the presence of some 
program-controlled hardware that could do some of the checking in parallel with
the main computation.
<p>For the time being, techniques as shown are probably more appropriate
in special purpose environments, such as, for instance, micro-programs or
just the instruction cycle. One of the reasons for undertaking all this was
my growing doubt, whether our techniques for the quality control of both,
chip design and chip construction, is sufficient. If techniques like the abov
can be transferred to that more microscopic level, we might feel confident
to catch in a single stroke both design errors and incidental machine 
malfunctionings.
